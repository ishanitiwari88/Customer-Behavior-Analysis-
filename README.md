# E-commerce Sales Analysis Report 
## Project Overview
This analysis consists of sales and revenue generated on an e-commerce website.
The products are categorized into 4 parts- Clothing, Books, Electronics, and Home. 

## Operations Performed
In this workbook  -

I have performed data cleaning, 

Visualization using static charts showing overall sales% as per categories and Popular payment methods, 

Made dynamic chart showing customer purchasing trend and revenue generated over time. You can select one or more categories, months, quarters, and years to see the trend chart as per your need.

I have also used VBA to show the total and category wise spend for each customer ID in the dataset. For this you just have to enter the customer ID in the column and it would update and show you the results for that specific customer.

At the end, I have written a report showing the overall performance in summary and recommended how and where we can make changes to increase the sales.



The Excel file is large and so I am proving a link from where you can view the project. I am also providing my basic VBA code just for reference.
